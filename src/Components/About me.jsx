            Hi! I'm Santhosh T, a passionate and detail-oriented front-end developer specializing in React.js. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, beautiful, and intuitive user interfaces. 
            I have experience building responsive web applications with modern technologies like React,
            JavaScript, and REST APIs. I'm always eager to learn and stay up-to-date with the latest in web development.
            When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring design trends, reading tech blogs, or working on side projects.
            My goal is to build scalable, user-friendly web apps that make a positive impact.
